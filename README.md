# DisplayLink Driver Manager for Ubuntu

A robust and user-friendly shell script to automate the installation and uninstallation of DisplayLink USB Graphics drivers on Ubuntu and its derivatives (like Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, etc.).

This script improves upon the manual installation process by providing error handling, dependency management, and a clean uninstall option.

## Features

-   ‚úÖ **Install & Uninstall**: Easily install or completely uninstall the DisplayLink driver with a simple command.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Automatic Dependency Handling**: Checks for and installs required packages like `dkms` and `unzip`.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Robust & Safe**: The script exits immediately if any command fails (`set -e`) and uses secure temporary directories for downloads.
-   üìù **Detailed Logging**: All actions are logged to `/var/log/displaylink-installer.log` for easy troubleshooting.
-   üé® **User-Friendly Output**: Color-coded terminal output makes it easy to follow the script's progress.
-   ‚ú® **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files and directories are automatically removed after execution.

## Prerequisites

-   An Ubuntu-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint).
-   `sudo` or root privileges.
-   An active internet connection to download the driver.

## Usage

You can either clone this repository or download the script directly.

### 1. Get the Script

**Option A: Clone the repository (recommended)**

```sh
git clone [https://github.com/Thugney/Displaylink-ubuntu-installer.git](https://github.com/Thugney/Displaylink-ubuntu-installer.git)
cd Displaylink-ubuntu-installer

```

### 2. Make the Script Executable

Before running the script, you need to give it execute permissions.

```sh
chmod +x manage-displaylink.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script

Run the script with `sudo` and choose one of the available options.

#### To Install the Driver:

This is the default action. The script will download the latest DisplayLink driver, install dependencies, and run the official installer.

```sh
sudo ./manage-displaylink.sh --install
# Or simply:
sudo ./manage-displaylink.sh
```

#### To Uninstall the Driver:

This will run the official DisplayLink uninstaller to cleanly remove the driver and its components from your system.

```sh
sudo ./manage-displaylink.sh --uninstall
```

#### To Get Help:

Displays the help message with all available options.

```sh
./manage-displaylink.sh --help
```

A system reboot is required after installation or uninstallation for the changes to take full effect.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, the first place to look is the log file. It contains a detailed record of all the steps the script took, including any errors.

You can view the log file with:
```sh
cat /var/log/displaylink-installer.log
```
Or follow it in real-time during execution:
```sh
tail -f /var/log/displaylink-installer.log
```
